            <h2>Hi!</h2>
            <p>
                What a suprise, another person learnign to code! <br>
                Yep, like many others right now I'm learning to code. I say learning it's more like refreshing, updating and adding to my current knowledge. Currently I teach CS at secondary school...which doesn't allow me to further develop my skills all that much due to workload, time and just a shitty curriculum (thanks stupid DfE and exam boards!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway I want an exit plan and currently feel de-skilled regretting not pushing myself harder. I have picked up a few courses, read a few tutorials but either finish them and forget everything or just leave them behind. <br>
            </p>
            <p>The plan...going to try the #100daysofcode and see what comes of it. I'm going to try to document the process as I go on here or social media and we'll see what happens. First I'm gonna get a basic site and blog up and running and go from there.</p>
